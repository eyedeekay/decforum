Welcome to DECForum
===================

This is a forum where the conversation is backed by a git repository. Each message is a separate commit which is referenced by itâ€™s hash. You can use markdown to write posts, and they will be rendered back to you as HTML. There is no login, posters are identified by the base32 address of the client which they use to connect to the server.
```
